Mod Menu for older versions of Geometry Dash (pre-1.9).

Currently being tested on version 1.22.

To compile: Run build script (TODO instructions for Windows)
You must also insert all the files in the resources folder into the APK assets folder.

## Special Thanks
- akqanile (Adelfa) - 100 KB fix
- Capeling - Soggy Mod
- Eclipse Mod Menu team - many hack implementations
